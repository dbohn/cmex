| Application Error Logger
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Here we will configure the error logger setup for the application which
| is built on top of the wonderful Monolog library. By default we will
| build a rotating log file setup which creates a new file each day.
|
| We will bind this setup routine inside a Closure. This allows us to not
| actually include the logger files until something really needs to be
| logged by your application, speed up requests that don't use logs.

| Application Error Handler
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Here you may handle any errors that occur in your application, including
| logging them or displaying custom views for specific errors. You may
| even register several error handlers to handle different types of
| exceptions. If nothing is returned, the default error view is
| shown, which includes a detailed stack trace during debug.

| Require The Filters File
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Next we will load the filters file for the application. This gives us
| a nice separate location to store our route and application filter
| definitions instead of putting them all in the main routes file.
