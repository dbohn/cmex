#cmex! - next generation

This is a CMS based on Laravel 4.

It focuses on providing a consistent interface for adding "chunks" to a page, which are first of all just a piece of data, but which can be lifted up to complex forms, blogs etc. by your chunk-class.
By now it's in an early stage, but under active development.
